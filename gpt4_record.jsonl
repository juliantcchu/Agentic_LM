And then, retrieve the broom from the locker in the vault. And then, sit the broom on the table. And once you've done that, you win!\n\n-= Vault =-\nI just think it's awesome that you're in a vault now. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can make out a locker. You see an opened box.

Your first objective is to take the Canadian latchkey from the dresser inside the sauna. And then, unlock the Canadian box in the sauna. After that, make it so that the Canadian box inside the sauna is ajar. Having pulled open the Canadian box, pick up the key from the Canadian box. With the key, make it so the chest is locked.

You shudder, but continue examining the room. You make out a spherical chest. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best?\n\nThere is a closed hatch leading south.
